# Revature_Project0
Console-based Banking Application


P0 - Java Angular Enterprise
Project 0 For Project 0, you will be building a console-based application that will be presented on Wednesday, May 18th, 2022. 

For this application you may choose one of the following concepts: 
- a banking application 
- course registration application 
- any other trainer-approved idea that is similar in functionality to the above project ideas (explicit trainer approval required for this) 

Banking Application Details User Stories As a user, I can: 
- [ ] register a new user account with the system (must be secured with a password) 
- [ ] login with my existing credentials  -- customer object
- [ ] create at least one account 
- [ ] deposit funds into an account (use doubles, not ints) 
- [ ] withdraw funds from an account (no overdrafting!) 
- [ ] view the balance of my account(s) (all balance displays must be in proper currency format) 

Suggested Bonus User Stories As a user I can: 
- [ ] view the transaction history for an account 
- [ ] create multiple accounts per user (checking, savings, etc.) 
- [ ] share a joint account with another user 
- [ ] transfer money between accounts 	


All project concepts must display the following domain-independent features/requirements: 
[ ] Use of custom data structures or java.util Collection types 
[ ] Basic validation of user input (e.g. no registration for classes outside of registration window, no negative deposits/withdrawals, no overdrafting, etc.) 
[ ] Unit tests for all business-logic classes 
[ ] All exceptions are properly caught and handled  - EXCEPTION HANDING
[ ] Proper use of OOP principles â€“ INHERITANCE, POLYMORPHISM, ENCAPSULATION, ABSTRACTION
[ ] Documentation (all classes and methods have basic documentation) 
[ ] Database is 3rd Normal Form Compliant 
[ ] Referential integrity (e.g. if a class is removed from the catalog, no students should be registered for it) 
[ ] Logging messages and exceptions to a file using a custom logger 
[ ] Generation of basic design documents (e.g. relational diagram, class diagram, flows, etc.) 

Tech Stack Regardless of the project concept you choose, you will be required to adhere to the following tech stack: 
[ ] Java 8 
[ ] Apache Maven 
[ ] PostgreSQL (hosted on AWS RDS) 
[ ] Git SCM (hosted on GitHub) Repo Instructions 

Create a new repository within this organization (naming convention: firstname_lastname_p0) Keep this repository up to date with frequent commits and pushes (follow best practices!) It is recommended (though not required) that you implement some kind of branching strategy when implementing new features into your application 

Presentation 
[ ] finalized version of application must be pushed to personal repository within this organization by the presentation date 
[ ] 5 minute live demonstration of the implemented features
